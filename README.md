BetterTranslations
==================

This is a Repository where Vanilla Minecraft localizations may go, to improve those sometimes really bad translations.

This will be compiled into a Resource Pack, for anyone free to use. If you have time and you think the Minecraft translation of a language you are speaking needs improvement, go ahead and improve it here.

Better translations of Minecraft Mods may also go into here.
